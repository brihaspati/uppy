The core reason for that is how this plugin\n * interacts with Uppy's current pipeline design. The pipeline can handle files in steps,\n * including preprocessing, uploading, and postprocessing steps. This plugin initially\n * was designed to do its work in a preprocessing step, and let XHRUpload deal with the\n * actual file upload as an uploading step. However, Uppy runs steps on all files at once,\n * sequentially: first, all files go through a preprocessing step, then, once they are all\n * done, they go through the uploading step.\n *\n * For S3, this causes severely broken behaviour when users upload many files. The\n * preprocessing step will request S3 upload URLs that are valid for a short time only,\n * but it has to do this for _all_ files, which can take a long time if there are hundreds\n * or even thousands of files. By the time the uploader step starts, the first URLs may\n * already have expired. If not, the uploading might take such a long time that later URLs\n * will expire before some files can be uploaded.\n *\n * The long-term solution to this problem is to change the upload pipeline so that files\n * can be sent to the next step individually.

'paste' ([Copy Image] or [Copy Image Address], we can't discern between these two)\n      Don't do anything if there is 'file' item. .handlePaste in the DashboardPlugin will deal with all 'file' items.\n      If there are no 'file' items - handle 'text/plain' items.\n\n    2. 'drop'\n      Take 'text/uri-list' items. Safari has an additional item of .kind === 'file', and you may worry about the item being\n      duplicated (first by DashboardPlugin, and then by UrlPlugin, now), but don't. Directory handling code won't pay\n      attention to this particular item of kind 'file'.\n*/\n\n/**\n * Finds all links dropped/pasted from one browser window to another.\n *\n * @param {object} dataTransfer - DataTransfer instance, e.g. e.clipboardData, or e.dataTransfer\n * @param {string} isDropOrPaste - either 'drop' or 'paste'\n * @param {Function} callback - (urlString) => {}\n */\n\n\nmodule.exports = function forEachDroppedOrPastedUrl(dataTransfer, isDropOrPaste, callback) {\n  const items = toArray(dataTransfer.items);\n  let urlItems;\n\n  switch (isDropOrPaste) {\n    case 'paste':\n      {\n        const atLeastOneFileIsDragged = items.some(item => item.kind === 'file');\n\n        if (atLeastOneFileIsDragged) {\n          return;\n        }\n\n        urlItems = items.filter(item => item.kind === 'string' && item.type === 'text/plain');\n        break;\n      }\n\n    case 'drop':\n      {\n        urlItems = items.filter(item => item.kind === 'string' && item.type === 'text/uri-list');\n        break;\n      }\n\n    default:\n      {\n        throw new Error(`isDropOrPaste must be either 'drop' or 'paste', but it's ${isDropOrPaste}`);\n      }\n  }\n\n  urlItems.forEach(item => {\n    item.getAsString(urlString => callback(urlString));\n  });\n};","\"use strict\";\n\n/**\n * Little AbortController proxy module so we can swap out the implementation easily later.\n */\nexports.AbortController = globalThis.AbortController;\nexports.AbortSignal = globalThis.AbortSignal;\n\nexports.createAbortError = function (message) {\n  if (message === void 0) {\n    message = 'Aborted';\n  }\n\n  return new DOMException(message, 'AbortError');\n};","\"use strict\";\n\nvar _emitter, _events;\n\nfunction _classPrivateFieldLooseBase(receiver, privateKey) { if (!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(receiver, privateKey)) { throw new TypeError(\"attempted to use private field on non-instance\");
